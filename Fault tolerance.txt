## Fault Torelance

### In Kafka when the data is written to offsets, Kafka commits after reading certain bytes
### i.e from the offsets

### For instance running the Kafka Producer

```kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic kafka_topic```

Write some messages into your producer and after terminating your producer start your consumer 
you can still look at the data being sent to consumer


```kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic kafka_topic```
