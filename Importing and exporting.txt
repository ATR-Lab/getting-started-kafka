###Creating your test file

echo -e "foo\nthis\nis\KAFKA!" > testing.txt

### Setup connector in standalone mode pass in connection properties config then file connection config then file sync config (serialization)  all configs here ship w/ Kafka and act as templates
connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties config/connect-file-source.properties config/connect-file-sink.properties

# Once the above connector starts running, it will read test.txt
# and write to test.sink.txt
# We can see this by reading the contents of the file
cat test.sink.txt

# To see the data in the consumer run the following
kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic connect-test --from-beginning

# In a separate terminal window, add some lines to the file
echo "Another line" >> test.txt
